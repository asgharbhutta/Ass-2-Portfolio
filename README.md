# Assignment #2 - Advanced CSS by Asghar Bhutta
Discalimer: This assignment was to utilize all the concepts we apparently learned during our 3rd week of class time and to be honest most of these concepts were learned by myself due to the instructor and TAs lack of knowledge sharing.

Now on to the actual project documentation

# Things to know that do not work but were intended so:
- Resume link does not link to an actual resume
- Surf Report does not link, we have not done that project yet
- LED Wall does not link, we have not done that project yet
- Calculator does not link, we have not done that project yet
- Pastel Puzzles does not link, we have not done that project yet either
- No picture of myself (privacy for obvious reasons)
- About Me section text has been fabricated, not sure what to write here to get an employers attention but eventually I will fill this out

Run Buddy does link, that was the project we created in the first two weeks

# Purpose of Project
We were to utilize advanced CSS concepts to create a professional portfolio that we can build upon in the next few months to show employers that we are ready to be hired.  Not only that but as we learn new concepts those will be integrated into this professional portfolio.
- CSS grid was used to layout the "work" section
- Flexbox was used throughout the entire site to ensure the site looks correct when elements are in a line and when elements need to be aligned.
- Media Queries were used to showcase 3 different screen sizes that are common throughout this digital world making them Responsive when those pixel widths are reached.
- CSS Animations were used to hover over navigation elements, work elements and the contact section to showcase their usage.
- As per the acceptance criteria the first large application does not exist, please just use Run Buddy in it's place while grading.
