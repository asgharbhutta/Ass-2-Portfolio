                    Now this is a story all about how My life got flipped-turned upside down And I'd like to take a minute
                    Just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air. In west Philadelphia born and raised
                    On the playground was where I spent most of my days Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
                    When a couple of guys who were up to no good Started making trouble in my neighborhood
                    I got in one little fight and my mom got scared She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"
