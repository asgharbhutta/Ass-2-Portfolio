# Assignment #2 - Advanced CSS by Asghar Bhutta
Discalimer: This assignment was to utilize all the concepts we apparently learned during our 3rd week of class time and to be honest most of these concepts were learned by myself due to the instructor and TAs lack of knowledge sharing.

Now on to the actual project.

# Things to know that do not work but were intended so:
Resume link does not link to an actual resume
Surf Report does not link, we have not done that project yet
LED Wall does not link, we have not done that project yet
Calculator does not link, we have not done that project yet
Pastel Puzzles does not link, we have not done that project yet either.
- Run Buddy does link, that was the project we created in the first to weeks
